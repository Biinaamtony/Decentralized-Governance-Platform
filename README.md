# Transparent Supply Chain Tracking System

## Overview
This smart contract, written in Clarity, enhances transparency and traceability in supply chains. It allows manufacturers, suppliers, retailers, and consumers to track product movement and certifications in a decentralized manner.

## Features
- **Entity Registration:** Manufacturers, suppliers, retailers, and certifiers can register with specific roles.
- **Product Tracking:** Products transition through various states (Manufactured, In Transit, At Retailer, Sold, Recalled, etc.).
- **Certifications:** Certifiers can issue sustainability and ethical compliance certifications to products.
- **Audit Trail:** Products maintain a detailed history of ownership and movement.

## Smart Contract Functions
### 1. Entity Management
- `register-entity` - Registers an entity with a type (manufacturer, supplier, retailer, certifier, consumer).
- `get-entity` - Retrieves details of a registered entity.

### 2. Product Lifecycle
- `register-product` - Registers a new product under a manufacturer.
- `transfer-product` - Transfers product ownership between entities.
- `update-product-state` - Updates the productâ€™s status in the supply chain.
- `get-product` - Retrieves product details and its transaction history.

### 3. Certification
- `issue-certification` - Certifiers can assign sustainability certifications to products.
- `get-certification` - Fetches a product's certification details.

## Deployment Steps
1. Set up a Clarity-enabled blockchain environment (Stacks Blockchain).
2. Deploy the contract using the Clarity CLI or Stacks Explorer.
3. Interact with the contract through Clarity functions via a frontend or API service.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for improved security.
- Integrate IPFS for immutable certification storage.
- Develop a user-friendly UI for real-time product tracking.
